# STU-Speed-Testing-Utility
This program is a python script that uses speedtest-cli and MySQL connector to take a speedtest and export the data to a MySQL server. It was developed for a group project and is a real-world solution to an aspect of my current job. If deployed, the script would run on a Raspberry Pi or similar device and the data would be used to determine if certan ISPs are actually providing the speeds they guarantee. As a proof of concept, I have the script running on a personal Raspberry Pi. I used cron to schedule the script to execute every 15 minutes and upon reboot. I included my crontab file for reference to anyone looking for a similar solution. It should be noted that the network adapter on the Pi 3 and 4 will definitely skew the results of the tests, but as I said this is more of a proof of concept.
